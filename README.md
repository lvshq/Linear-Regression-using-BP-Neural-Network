# Linear-Regression-using-BP-Neural-Network
Train a BP Neural Network using 25000 samples with 384 features and predict another 25000 samples.

This is a in-class competition of linear regression.

This is a project of the Data Mining course (instructor: Dr. Yan Pan)
in 2016 for the students in School of Data and Computer Science, Sun Yat-sen University.

This is a linear regression task. Please use what you have learned from our course and write an algorithm to train a regressor.


Data Files

File Name	Available Formats

sample_submission	.csv (32 b)
train	.csv (36.38 mb)
test	.csv (36.13 mb)

You are given three files:

1.train.csv

The format of each line is as follows:

id,value0,value1,...,value383,reference

where value0,value1,...,value383 are the features.

2.test.csv

This file contains the features whose references you need to predict. The format of each line is as follows:

id,value0,value1,...,value383

3.sample_submission.csv

The file you submit should have the same format as this file,the format of each line is as follows:

id,reference
